# Matlab-Simulink--AC-AC-three-phase-converter2
MATLAB simulation of a Three-phase controller (AC-AC converter).
Three-phase voltage controllers Y-connected load.
The six SCRs are turned on at 60-degree intervals.
The value of the gate signal can be changed depending on the desired application, the same for the type of Load (R, RL, RC, RLC).
